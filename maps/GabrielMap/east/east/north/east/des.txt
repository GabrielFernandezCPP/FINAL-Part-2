Entering the room to your left, you find yourself at a crossroads. You find yourself facing a large stained glass window, shifting light filters in. The glass depicts one of the gods of Old, dressed in regal white robes. Despite the creepiness of the church, you stare in awe at the window. To your left you see an archway and so is on your right.
